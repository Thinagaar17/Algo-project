[SEOUL] South Korean exports for the first 10 days of April tumbled as the coronavirus health crisis upended global supply chains and knocked demand.

Asia's fourth-largest economy is considered a bellwether for world trade and is the first major exporting nation to release monthly trade data.

Exports for the first 10 days of the month dived 18.6 per cent from the same period a year earlier, a sharp reversal from the 20.8 per cent jump in March 1-10 period. Imports also dropped 13.0 per cent, compared to a 14.5 per cent rise in the previous month, according to Korea Customs Service data on Monday.

Shipments to China, South Korea's biggest trading partner and where the virus first originated late last year, declined 10.2 per cent, while those to the United States and the European Union also slumped 3.4 per cent and 20.1 per cent, respectively.


By products, overseas sales of semiconductors, the country's top export revenue generator, declined 1.5 per cent, while those of petrochemical products, car components and wireless devices plummeted 47.7 per cent, 31.8 per cent and 23.1 per cent each.
